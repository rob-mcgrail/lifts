prompt="You are watching a Claude Code agent that just finished its turn.
Your job: detect whether the agent LAZILY BAILED OUT.

A lazy bail-out is stopping while real work is within reach, citing nebulous
reasons like 'context budget,' 'token limit,' 'this is taking a lot of
tokens,' 'I'm running out of room,' 'this is getting long,' 'should I
continue,' 'I'll stop here for now,' or similar — when the user clearly just
wants the task done.

NOT a lazy bail-out:
- Stopping because the user explicitly said to stop / 'looks good' / etc.
- Stopping because the work is genuinely complete (the assistant summarized
  finished work, no obvious next step was deferred).
- A real blocker that's been clearly surfaced: a question waiting on the
  user, a permission denial, an external failure (tests broken with a
  reason, command errored, missing credentials).
- Asking a clarifying question that's genuinely needed.

Last assistant message (truncated to closing 4000 chars):
