# identical command, which is rare — so it can be long, and a month of not
# re-paying for `git status` is the whole point of the cache. (In practice the
# cache lives in /tmp, so a reboot clears it well before this expires.)
#
# DENYs expire fast, deliberately. A month-long denial is the dangerous
# direction: one bad verdict would wedge that exact command for a month with no
# obvious remedy, and re-judging is always the safe way to be wrong.
